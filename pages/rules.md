##### In order to run a fun and civil community, we ask that everyone follows the following rules:

---

### 1. **Be Polite.**  
We expect members of this community to be polite and kind to other members of the community. Jesting/Joking is fine, but please don't walk the line. This also applies to tagging. Please do not try to tag everyone, or random people in the discord server. Finally, mental health issues, and suicide are not topics that are taken lightly here. Because of this, any conversation related to it will be deleted. We would ask that you please go visit the awesome guys over at Patch Gaming: [https://discord.gg/0X1B9skZ7gU6i3IU](https://discord.gg/0X1B9skZ7gU6i3IU)

### 2. **No racism/sexism/homophobia/whateverisms, and no NSFW content This is a ONE STRIKE rule.**  
To clarify. You are given one strike. If you violate this rule twice, you are banned. We do not accept racism, sexism, homophobia, or anything of the sort. This is an accepting community, and this rule goes along with Rule #1. Depending on the mood of the moderator, and the gravity of the post, you may be banned with no warning/strikes for this rule.  

### 3. **No Spamming.**  
Spamming is not allowed anywhere in this community  

### 4. **Listen to the Staff**  
If the Staff requests something from you, or tells you to stop doing something, please abide by the request.

### 5. **Don't have a bad name**  
For example, "everyone" or "here" in Discord, or something that would break another rule.

### 6. **No Advertising/Advertisements.**  
Until further notice, advertising your discord/server/group/community/youtube is not allowed. If you want to advertise your twitch/youtube/whatever stream, post it in #streams. More details to come in the future. If you wish to advertise your discord server, please visit [https://discordservers.com/](https://discordservers.com/)

### 7. **Do not ask random people to come talk with you in Discord**  
If you want to talk with people, find a voice channel, and just hang out. If people want to talk, they can join the channel with you. Breaking this rule will get you a half-strike.

### 8. **No sockpuppets or ban dodging**  
Stick with one account, and if you are banned, stay banned.

___ 

You may be banned, kicked, or muted, at ANY time, by a member of the staff, for any reason, as its up to their discretion, but we will try to follow these rules.

Breaking any of these rules will grant you a _strike_. If you get 3 strikes (unless you break rule #2), you will be removed from the forum, and the discord server.
